        <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-16">With offices in both London and the Gold Coast, Raven & Lack is a house of design that represents the creative partnership between influential award-winning designers Rae Underhill and Adriel Lack.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif mb-4">Our Story</h2>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">{"Raven & Lack began as a truly inspired friendship between Rae Underhill and Adriel Lack. Having first worked together at a world-renowned architectural practice in Australia, both relocated to London to pursue their independent careers. Years of hard work and dedication saw them creatively leading teams at two of London's most highly regarded luxury design studios, Spinnochia Freund and 1508 London.\n\nAfter pursuing these individual endeavours, an ambition to rekindle their shared creative vision brought them together once more, with the pair founding the ultra-boutique studio Raven & Lack in 2019.\n\nToday, Raven & Lack has evolved into a full-service house of design, with a talented team of twelve specialists across interior architecture, furniture design, technical documentation, and procurement. Our bihemispherical design aesthetic draws inspiration from the finest makers and design traditions we explore in our travels, bringing a truly international perspective to projects across Australia, Europe, and the Middle East.\n\nWith over 40 years of combined industry experience creating luxury properties around the world, we've built an impressive portfolio and developed an innate understanding of client expectations within the luxury sector."}</p>

            <h3 className="text-neutral-900 mb-4">Design for a Luxurious Life</h3>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">{"We adhere first and foremost to the creation of a narrative that aligns with and enhances our clients' lifestyle and personal requirements, integrating multidisciplinary elements such as spatial design, lighting design, integrated technology, art curation, dressing and styling.\n\nThrough the enigmatic combination of material, matter and friendship, we sculpt rooms piece by piece. With details to be discovered. And simple curves that set everything straight.\n\nSourcing from the corners of the world to the homes of tomorrow, each room is left with a final touch of something grand. Something to be found. Something that must be felt.\n\nOur dedication to the creative design process and our collaborative approach on all our projects ensures that they are wholly unique and individually tailored. We create harmonious, cohesive spaces that evoke our philosophy of luxury as approachable, engaging, and above all, liveable."}</p>

            <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">{"More than anything, our strength is in our ability to operate as a collective, both within the Raven & Lack team and together with external consultants. This collaborative spirit extends to our extensive network of international manufacturers and suppliers, creating an enigmatic chemistry that promotes innovative, dynamic resolutions.\n\nOur approach to every project is to provide consistent, highly resolved design solutions and future-proofed design, delivered on time and within any set budget parameters. We take a proactive approach to maximise the potential of any design, creating optimum layouts that amplify opportunities while maintaining flexibility of space."}</p>
            <p className="text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mt-6">Although we traditionally offer an all-inclusive service of interior design and FF&E, we also offer clients a consultancy service purely for creative direction as it is our specialised expertise.
